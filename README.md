# Data Analyst Bootcamp

This is a program I've took part in to learn new skills to become a Data Analyst as my new career focus.

Started with find and watch videos that have subjects related to "dashboard", "analyst",... I found the channel Alex The Analyst which was inspired me to dig deeper into this field - Data Analyst, and made me feel motivated to navigate my focus on it.

First, technically I'd only known about Excel with fomulas, pivot table then power query, power pivot, VBA but I think it's actually a fine start.

After this bootcamp, I've learned more about querying data using SQL, building a dashboard on Power BI.

So many things that as much I know about it as more interesting I feel about this Data Analyst job.

Finished this bootcamp is my first step on the way to approach my goal.
